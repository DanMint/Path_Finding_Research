# Path Finding Research

This research project was the final assignment in my master's course, EECE5554 (Robotics Sensing and Navigation), at *Northeastern University*. In this project, I used the Graph SLAM library to simulate how a robot navigates and forms paths in unfamiliar areas. For a more detailed understanding of this research, please refer to the *Final Project Report.pdf* , where everything is thoroughly explained.
